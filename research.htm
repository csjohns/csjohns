		  <p>My research examines outcomes from participatory governance innovations in developed democracies.  Participatory governance (PG), the formal extension of public voice into political decision-making beyond the ballot box, has become increasingly prominent over recent decades.  This expansion has been propelled by a wide range of democratic outcomes ascribed to these institutional reforms, including improved accountability, stronger norms of citizenship and a more civic-minded public, increased voter turnout and more legitimate government.  However, the empirical study of PG has been dominated by case studies of celebrated successes or limited evaluation of within country variation in implementation.  My research is positioned as part of a broader move toward systematic, comparative analysis of outcomes from participatory innovation.</p>
		  <p>My dissertation research looks specifically at the implementation of participatory budgeting, a process in which a government sets aside part of a public budget for the community to allocate, in the <a href="http://participatorybudgeting.org">US</a> and the <a href="http://www.pbpartners.org.uk/pb-network/">UK</a>.  I ask in my dissertation whether and how the introduction of PB has an impact on political behavior and the quality of democracy over the broad community where it is implemented. I develop a new institutional theory of how participatory governance reforms like PB may reasonably be expected to have an impact that extends beyond the momentary intervention of the public in a single policy decision.  I argue that the introduction of PB institutions can alter patterns of communication and agenda-setting in ways that facilitate future political mobilization, collaboration, and transformation of public preferences, strengthening democratic politics more broadly.</p>
	<p>Building on broader insights from new institutional theories of politics, social movement scholarship, and public administration, I develop a theory articulating the informational mechanisms through which participatory reforms may result in transformations of patterns of local political participation and preference articulation. I test this theory with a two-part multi-method research design. In depth interviews and observation of four cases of PB in the US and UK allow for process tracing to test for the operation of expected mechanisms while comparative analysis of a wide range of community-level outcomes across paired PB/non-PB cases test for substantive democratic outcomes.   I have already completed the qualitative fieldwork and process analysis for two of the four cases, with the remaining two to be completed this spring.</p>
		  <p>With the support of an NSF Dissertation Improvement Award, I am extending the existing theory-building and case study 
			work, examining broader community-level impacts from participatory budgeting.  This new work includes both a survey of community
   			organizations both in areas implementing PB and matched communities that have not implemented PB, as well as a novel
			approach to measuring changes in political culture through the use of supervised machine learning methods for 
			analysis of local political reporting and discussion.
<p>Earlier research, now published in the journal <i>Political Studies</i>, emerged from my MA essay at UW and examines the relationship between local civic participation and expressions of government legitimacy.   In this project,  I make explicit a theoretical basis for this relationship, paying particular attention to the conceptual construction of legitimacy, and build indices for civic participation and legitimating attitudes. I use MLE methods to test empirical implications using detailed individual level data on local participation, attitudes, and values from the UK Citizenship Survey. This research supports claims of a relationship between participation and legitimacy, even when outcomes are perceived negatively, and that this effect is specific to procedural and fairness components of legitimacy rather than simple 'trust' in government.</p>
