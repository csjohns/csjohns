  		  <p>I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, 
and a consultant at the <a href="http:\\julius.csscr.washington.edu">Center for Social Science Computation and Research</a></p>
<p>I am working on a dissertation evaluating community-level democratic outcomes from the implementation of participatory budgeting, in which citizens of a community are given control over some part of the government's budget.  I have taken field exams in comparative politics, political communication, and social science methodology.  I have graduate certification in social science statistics, but have maintained a focus on fieldwork and ethnographic methods, and use multiple methods with great enthusiasm in my research. I am affiliated with the <a href=http://www.csss.washington.edu/index.shtml>Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences<a> and the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mlevi/chaos.html">Center for Comparative and Historical Analysis of Organizations and States</a></p>
	<p>Prior to my return home to the lovely Pacific Northwest, I received my A.B. from Harvard with a joint concentration in Social Studies and Gender Studies, worked enthusiastically in Green Party organizing in Massachusetts, ran for State Representative, and realized I wanted to learn more about politics more formally.  This took me to Oxford University for an MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government), after which I tried working outside of academia as a research assistant with the London-based global governance and accountability thinktank the One World Trust and spending a while absorbing the public sector culture in England. I realized two things: 1) I wanted to pursue a PhD and 2) I really wanted to know what was going on with the wave of "public involvement" promotion I was participating in in London. This brought me back to Seattle and the excellent training at the University of Washington.</p>
       
      <p>Outside academia, I'm an active climber and mountaineer. When I feel like I have too much time on my hands (hah!)I occasionally will do a theatrical lighting design.</p>
