<p><a href="http://www.statmethods.net/index.html"><em>Quick-R</span></em></a>
is one of the most accessible resources for R out there, which I have often
found myself back at when I thought I needed something more confusing. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p><a
href="http://staff.washington.edu/csjohns/R-refcard.pdf">R Reference
card</a> is a fairly dense reference to basic and common commands in R<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>UCLA has some <a
href="http://statistics.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/">extensive reference pages</a> for
students learning to use R.</p>

<p></p>Searching for help:

<p>Google is your friend. Seriously - someone else has probably had a similar problem as you in the past and has hopefully figured it out. R is a common letter of the alphabet, so very specific searches,
including function commands or specific bits of code can be helpful to generate
relevant results.</p>

<p>You may also want to try <a href="http://www.rseek.org/">rseek.org</a>
which has already tried to filter the internet appropriately</p>

<h4><strong>LaTeX Resources</strong></h4>
You may find it worthwhile to learn and work in LaTeX for methods courses or in further work. Here are a few basic resources you may find helpful:
<p><a href="http://www.ctan.org">CTAN</a> (The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) has a useful <a href="http://www.ctan.org/starter.html">starter page</a> that may be helpful if you're using for the first time.</p>
<p>LaTeX <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">wikibook</a> is extensive and fairly intuitive to use.</p>
<p>Oh look, another <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/csjohns/R-refcard.pdf">refcard</a> for LaTeX!</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">not-so-short introduction</a> to LaTeX.</p>
<p>Finally, here is a <a href="503/HWtemplate.tex">very basic LaTeX template</a> for students wanting to start out in Latex. It's designed for homework assignments for CSSS courses.
